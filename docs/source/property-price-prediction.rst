==========================


In this tutorial, you will learn:

* The basics in macroeconomic analysis
* The ways of analyzing macroeconomic indicators
* How to build a house price prediction model

Intro to macroeconomic analysis
-------------------------------

| As we have discussed in the first tutorial, macroeconomic analysis is a ways of
  investigating the macroeconomic indicators that influence the stock market.
  
| In this module, we will first analyze the macroeconomic indicators and explore how 
  the indicators affect the stock prices in Hong Kong. 
  
| Then, we will specifically analyze the Hong Kong real estate market, as we believe
  that it is one of the most important macroeconomic indicator that can reflect the
  Hong Kong's economy.

| In addition, we will build a house price prediction model.
