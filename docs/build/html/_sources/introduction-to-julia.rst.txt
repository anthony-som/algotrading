Introduction to Julia
============================

Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language that is designed for numerical analysis and computational science.
`Nature <https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02310-3>`_ describes it as the "*best of both worlds*" - a language that combines the interactivity and syntax of 'scripting' languages, 
such as Python, Matlab and R, with the speed of 'compiled' languages such as Fortran and C.

Why use Julia
----------------------

Julia is designed for speed, performance and scalability. Here are some highlights about the best features of Julia:

- It has a legible syntax and is easy to learn.
- It incorporates vector notations and DataFrames as part of the language.
- It compiles codes in advance and thus is designed to be fast.


Many financial firms including BlackRock and State Street are using Julia as their primary development language. 
With the belief that the community for Julia will continue to grow, here we would like to introduce 
some examples of using Julia to write algorithmic trading strategies. 


Getting started
-----------------

The official repo and installation instructions could be found `here <https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/>`_.

Here are some good tutorials for picking up the language:
