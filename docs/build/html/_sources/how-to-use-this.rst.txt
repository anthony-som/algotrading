What this is
--------------

| Welcome to the **Algo Trading Learning Repo**! This is an educational resource produced by 
  undergraduate students at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) to make it easier 
  to learn about algorithmic trading.

| The code repository could be accessed `here <https://github.com/awoo424/algotrading>`_. 
  It contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

* a short introduction to algo trading terminology, basic theory and data science
* explanation and equation of common technical indicators
* code implementation of technical & fundamental analysis strategies in Python
* code examples of using machine learning for stock screening and trend analysis

| We recommend beginners to start with the :any:`Introduction`, and for coders who have a 
  basic understanding of technical analysis & fundamental analysis could 
  jump right into :any:`Technical analysis`.


Why we built this
-------------------

| Algorithmic trading is a multidisciplinary field that involves knowledge in three domains, 
  which are finance, programming and statistics. While one could easily look for online 
  learning resources on the Internet nowadays, they still present various challenges to a 
  beginner who would like to learn the field from scratch:

* There are lots of blog posts and online materials about algo trading, but 
  they are scattered; and are usually just focusing on a few concepts or topics.
* There exist open-source repositories that feature the implementation of a wide 
  selection of algo trading strategies, but they do not come along with explanations 
  and assume that the user knows the financial logic behind.
* On the other hand, there exist good resources that provide detailed discussions about 
  financial concepts and rationale of trading strategies `Investopedia <https://www.investopedia.com/}{Investopedia>`_, 
  but they are not accompanied by any code examples.
* Majority of the resources do not fit the local context (e.g. about trade execution in Hong Kong) 
  and are merely focusing on the US market.

| Personally, we also find this process inefficient and daunting. 
  Being a group of students who are majoring in Computer Science and Finance at the 
  university right now, we are eager to dedicate our efforts into 
  creating learning resources that could align with the financial setting of 
  Hong Kong, and could pique the interest of beginners.
