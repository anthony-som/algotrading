<p class="admonition-title">Definition</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Algorithmic trading</strong> (a.k.a. algo trading) is the use of computer codes
and chart analysis to enter and exit trades automatically according to
set parameters such as price movements or volatility levels.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In algo trading, one writes an algorithm and instruct a computer to buy or sell
stocks for you when the defined conditions are met. These programs can trade at
speed and frequency that is much higher than that of a human trader, and the process
can be semi-automated or completely automated. This is why sometimes we could use
the term <strong>“automated trading”</strong> interchangelably, but note that they are not
necesssarily referring to the same thing.</div>
</div>
<p>A typical algorithmic trading system does the following things (in order):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Inspect data, charts, quotes or news and generate trade signals as per your strategy</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in order details when a trade signal is found</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor and evaluate trades to see if they reached your target or went in the opposite direction</p></li>
<li><p>Close positions to either book profits or cut losses</p></li>
<li><p>Rinse and repeat</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="automated-trading">
<h3>Automated Trading<a class="headerlink" href="#automated-trading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Automated Trading is the absolute automation of the trading process. Trading orders
are automatically created, submitted to the market and executed. Automated trading
facilities are usually utilized by hedge funds that exploit proprietary execution
algorithms and trade via Direct-Market Access (DMA) or sponsored access.</div>

<div class="line">High-frequency Trading (HFT) is a subset of automated trading. Technology has enabled
orders to be made within milliseconds. As execution speed is of a priority here,
HFT makes use of Direct-Market Access (DMA) in order to reduce the time transactions.

<div class="line">There are two major schools of methods for analysing the market,
which are (1) technical analysis and (2) fundamental analysis.
We’ll go through both of these in detail respectively in the coming tutorials.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-technical-analysis">
<h2>What is technical analysis?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-technical-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="myownstyle admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Definition</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Technical analysis</strong> is the study of market action, primarily through
the use of charts, for the purpose of forecasting future price trends. - <em>John J. Murphy</em></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Here, the term <em>“market action”</em> (or price data, as some people call it)
refers to to any combination of the open, high, low, close, volume, or
open interest for a given security over a specific timeframe. The timeframe
can be based on intraday (1-minute, 5-minute, 10-minute, 15-minute,
30-minute or hourly), daily, weekly or monthly price data and last a few
hours or many years.</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale-of-technical-analysis">
<h3>Rationale of technical analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale-of-technical-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>1. Market Action Discounts Everything</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This assumption states that any factor that could possibly affect the stock’s
price - fundamental, political, psychological, or otherwise - is fully reflected
in the price of that stock. In other words, it is presumed that prices should
reflect shifts in demand and supply. For example, if prices are rising, no
matter the reasons behind, demand must exceed supply and thus the fundamentals
must be bullish. Conversely, if prices fall, the fundamentals must be bearish.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Hence as a rule, technicians do not concern themselves with the reasons why
prices rise or fall. If everything that affects the market prices is ultimately
reflected in market price, then it makes sense that they study of that market price
is all that is necessary. That’s why this assumption serves as a cornerstone for
technical analysis to work.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>2. Prices Move in Trends</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Unless one accepts that markets do in fact trend, there’s no point in reading any
further. Given the assumption that prices move in trends, we obtain the corollary
that a trend in motion is likely to continue than to reverse. Just like Newton’s
first law of motion. The entire trend-following approach is predicated on riding
an existing trend, until a sign of reversing is observed.</div>
</div>
<p><strong>3. History repeats itself</strong></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Under this assumption, it is believed that the key to understanding the future
lies in a study of the past. Charts tend to form shapes that have occurred in
the past, and thus the analysis of historical patterns helps predict future
market movements.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pros-and-cons-of-technical-analysis">
<h3>Pros and cons of technical analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#pros-and-cons-of-technical-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Objectiveness</p></li>
<li><p>Mathematical precision</p></li>
<li><p>Emotional indifference</p></li>
<li><p>Inexpensive</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Self-fulfilling prophecy</p></li>
<li><p>The future keeps running away</p></li>
<li><p>Conflicting signals from different indicators</p></li>
<li><p>Substantial movements might have taken place when a pattern is identified</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-fundamental-analysis">
<h2>What is fundamental analysis?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-fundamental-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">While technical analysis concentrates on the study of market action,
the fundamental analysis focuses on the economic forces of supply
and demand that leads to price movements.</div>
</div>
<div class="myownstyle admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Definition</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The <strong>fundamental analysis</strong> approach examines all of the relevant factors affecting
the price of a stock in order to determine the intrinsic value of that
stock. - <em>John J. Murphy</em></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The term <em>“intrinsic value”</em> here refers to what the stock is actually worth
based on the law of supply and demand. If the intrinsic value is below
the current market price, it means that the stock is overpriced and
thus it should be sold. Conversely, if the intrinsic value is above the
price, then the market is undervalued and that stock should be bought.</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale-of-fundamental-analysis">
<h3>Rationale of fundamental analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale-of-fundamental-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">One of the primary assumptions of fundamental analysis is that the current price from the stock market
often does not fully reflect the value of a company. Thus, a fundamentalist would look at a company’s
publicly available information and other economic data in order to gain an understanding of the company’s
ability to create products and services, and to evaluate whether it is generating earnings in aproductive way.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This approach stems from the assumption that the reported financial information is legitimate and correct.
A fundamentalist may also assume that a company’s past performance and metrics may continue into the future.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Fundamental analysis consists of three main parts:</div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Economic analysis</strong> - focuses on analysing various macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation, and GDP levels</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Industry analysis</strong> - focuses on assessing specific prospects and potential opportunities within the identified industries and sectors</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Company analysis</strong> - focuses on analysing and selecting individual stocks within the most promising industries</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We could conduct fundamental analysis either in a <strong>top-down approach</strong> or <strong>bottom-up approach</strong>. By following the former, the investor
will start with analysing the health of the overall economy, and then to determine the industry trends, and thus filter out promising companies
within the industry. With regards to latter, it will be the reverse - beginning with individual stock analysis first, to find out stocks
that could outperform the industry.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pros-and-cons-of-fundamental-analysis">
<h3>Pros and cons of fundamental analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#pros-and-cons-of-fundamental-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Seeks to understand the value of an asset</p></li>
<li><p>Long-term view</p></li>
<li><p>Comprehensive</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Time-consuming</p></li>
<li><p>Results not suitable for quick decisions</p></li>
<li><p>Does not provide info about entry points*</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">With regards to the last point, some investors would try to complement fundamental analysis by
making use of technical analysis to decide entry points in the identified stocks.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="technical-analysis-vs-fundamental-analysis">
<h2>Technical analysis vs Fundamental analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-analysis-vs-fundamental-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Both of these approaches intend to solve the same problem - to determine
the direction that prices are liekly to move. While technical analysis
focuses more on answering the question of “when to buy”, fundamental analysis
helps us find an answer to the question of “what to buy”.</div>
</div>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The fundamentalist studies the cause of market movement, while the
technician studies the effect. - <em>John J. Murphy</em></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Theoretically, the technician would, according to the assumptions, ignore the
reasons that cause prices to change, and the fundamentalist would constantly be
digging into the causes of price movements. However, in reality there is a lot
of overlap between these two approaches, and they are not mutually exclusive.
<strong>The problem of using a combination of both, is that the technical indicators
and fundamentals might come in conflict with each other</strong>, and such descrepancies
especially occur at the most critical moments.</div>
</div>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Buy-low-and-sell-high.jpg"><img alt="&quot;One does not simply buy low and sell high.&quot;" class="align-center" src="_images/Buy-low-and-sell-high.jpg" style="width: 275px; height: 162px;" /></a>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Some people believe the fact that “market price tends to lead the known fundamentals”
accounts for this phenomenon. Put it in another way, it implies that the market price
acts as a leading indicator of the fundamentals. While the known fundamentals are already
reflected “in the market”, they are now reacting to the unknown fundamentals, and thus
inducing the discrepancy.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In learning about the premises of technical analysis, one can see why technicians
usually see their approach superior to fundamentalists’. Because, by definition,
if the fundamentals are reflected in the market price, then technical approach
includes the fundamental. Nevertheless, fundamental analysis does not include a
study of market action. Therefore, whilee it is feasible to trade solely relying
on technial approach, it is doubtful that anyone could trade off the fundamentals
alone without any consideration of the technical side of the market.</div>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Algorithmic Trading has become increasingly popular in the recent decade, and
it now accounts for the majority of trades in the market globally and has attributed
to the success of some of the world’s best-performing hedgee funds. Indeed, 84% of
trades that happened in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and 60% in London Stock
Exchange (LSE) were all done using algorithmic trading. Therefore, whether one
is interested in making money with algo trading or not, studying algo trading
would definitely bring you insights on how technolgy has been applied in stock
markets and learn how algorithms have been shaping our modern day world.</div>
